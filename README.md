## Features

### Responsive design

The template was created for all kind of screens and have suitable css included.

### Different roles - different views 

If you create a ticket for testing or edit an existing one with write permissions (e.g. trainer) you will see a red field for status and feedback. Do not wonder: Users without write permissions (e.g. students) only see a clean page with the fields they need for their ticket.

### Navigation

After creating a ticket or by clicking the magnifying glass in the listview you will the entry in the singleview. On top and bottom of the single ticket are links for switching to the listview, so users don't have to use the default dropdown therefore. All the database buttons are prepared for an easy navigation, too.

### Listview

The ticketsystem has a clear but comprehensive listview. You have an overview for a ticket and the opportunity for unfolding the summary and the feedback by clicking on the table fields. In addition of that the status badge has a rounded pill for notifying if there is a feedback.

### Anonymous or public tickets

If you activate grades for your database tickets cannot be seen from other users.

### Event

You can set up some events for new and editing entries. Tipp: You can put the direct link to the events into the activity description.
